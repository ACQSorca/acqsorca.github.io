    <p>My name is Addison C. Quijano Sorca from Spring Valley, NV. I am a Filipino-American whose parents hail from Pasig City, NCR and Libacao, Aklan. I was born on October 23, 1998 at Sunrise Hospital in Winchester, Nevada. I have a sister who is two years younger than me and five half-brothers back in the Philippines. I have three pets: two dogs and a bitch. I am interested in animation, politics, computer coding, history, graphic design, and trivia.</p>

    <p>I am ACA certified in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash. I am proficient in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP, SQL, and am currently working on learning Java. I can speak some Spanish and Tagalog.</p>
    
    <p>I also don't like talking about myself a lot.</p>
