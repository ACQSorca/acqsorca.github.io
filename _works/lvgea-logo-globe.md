This is an alternate logo for the 60th Anniversary of the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance. Like the stylized representation of Clark County logo, it uses the LVGEA colors. Each colored line represents trade between Las Vegas and the rest of the world, emphasizing the "Global" part of "Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance".
