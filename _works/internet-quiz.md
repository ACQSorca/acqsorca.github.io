Currently hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://acqsorca.github.io/Internet_Quiz>, the Internet Quiz is a four topic quiz: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the history of the Internet, with each quiz containing ten questions. There is also a quiz that takes ten random questions from each topic. Questions are stored as objects in an array, with the correct answer placed in a random position. After pressing submit, the code checks to see if the selected answer is the correct answer and adjusts and colors the scoreboard accordingly.
