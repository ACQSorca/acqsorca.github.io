Dawson and my Capstone, Culture-a-Day, was a interactive site written in PHP. Each day, a link to a new country would appear on the home page. The link would take the user to articles about the country's history, system of government, values and traditions, and other aspects of said country. Users who signed up for accounts could "stamp" the articles of countries they've visited, which would add a link to their personal "passport" archive. We wanted to teach others about places other than their home, expand their horizons. SQL queries were made using PDO prepared statements and passwords were properly hashed and salted.
