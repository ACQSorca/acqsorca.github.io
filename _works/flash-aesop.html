Back in Sophomore year we were taught how to use Adobe Flash. Afterwards, we were given a parody of an aesop's fable and told to make an animation about said fable. Mine was a story about a physician who attended the funeral of one of his patients, and a dog who asked the physician about "digging up" his bones to "pick at". Unfortunately I spent too much time on planning the animation and not enough to finish, but I do have a lip-synced puppet now.
