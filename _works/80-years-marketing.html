In order to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the beginning of marketing education in universities, my class was approached to create a logo that could be used on t-shirts and websites. My idea for the logo uses a simple, modern design that became popular during the 1960s in advertising, even using Helvetica as a font. Each image in the logo is a medium in which marketers have advertised in, beginning with radio and ending with smartphones. The arrow is a nod to hand-drawn diagrams marketers use to demonstrate how they plan to reach their target audience.
