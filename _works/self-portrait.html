In order to show that we were proficient at Adobe Illustrator we spent several weeks creating a portrait of ourselves in that program. We were taught how to use the pen tool and direct selection tool to create and manipulate BÃ©zier curves. We were also taught that we should create closed shapes so the fill will work correctly and how to use several other tools, such as the pathfinder tool, in order to further manipulate the shapes.
