# Explanation of the Project
To show our knowledge of color schemes, we were split into groups of three or four. Each member of the group was assigned a color scheme. Mine, on the far left, was analogous colors, or colors next to each other on the color wheel. We then chose a picture to digitally trace over using a drawing tablet, using the color scheme.

# Reflection
I like how this project turned out. It looks nice and I'm proud of my section.
